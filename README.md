# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Course Project Directions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Steps 

1. Download the data source 
2. Set working directory and read table before running through the steps.
3. Run analysis which will generate a new tidy file in working directory.
